mipod
======

A nodejs module for exposing a REST API and Websocket for the Music Player Daemon (MPD). Written in Typescript, it generates ready-to-use Javascript.
Javascript + node package lies in folder [javascript](https://github.com/jotak/mipod/tree/master/javascript)

It can be used either as a nodejs dependency module or as a stand-alone server.

Mipod provides basic MPD commands exposed as REST resources or Websocket, such as *'GET /mipod/play'*.
It also provides more advanced library management, still through REST resources or Websocket. You can control playback, save and load playlists, browse the musics files folder by folder or get all in a go. There are also some non-MPD features such as songs rating.

## Usage

1. Stand-alone REST server
  As a stand-alone server, you only need the javascript files under directory _javascript_. Copy them to the place you want, and run mipod-rest.js with node:
  * *node mipod-rest.js*
  
  That's all you need to start the server with default parameters. It will listen to requests on port 80 and connects to a MPD server on localhost:6600. Try out http://localhost/mipod/play or http://localhost/mipod/pause, if you have an MPD server running, you should hear immediate results.

  Configurable options are:
  * **-p=$X, --port=$X** setup server port (default 80)
  * **--prefix=$path** setup root for REST requests (default /mipod)
  * **--mpdHost=$host** MPD server hostname (default localhost)
  * **--mpdPort=$X** MPD server port (default 6600)
  * **--dataPath=$path** local path where data files will be stored
  * **--dontUseLibCache** deactivate MPD caching (will be slower, but saves memory - see dedicated section below for more information).
  * **--loadLibOnStartup** load the whole library from MPD on startup and refresh its cache.
  * **-h, --help** help

2. Stand-alone Websocket server
    It's very similar to the REST server. Run:
  * *node mipod-ws.js*
  
  And the server will listen on default port (80) for websocket events. Options are the same than for the REST server, only **--prefix** will differ a bit since it won't prefix the REST resource obviously, but the websocket word event. Also, its default value is just empty (no prefix).

3. Node module inclusion
  You can download sources from github, or use npm (https://www.npmjs.org/package/mipod - note that only javascript is packaged with NPM, you wouldn't have access to typescript code this way). Since mipod is written in [typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), you may want to benefit from this and import it in your own typescript code:
  * **import mipod = require('mipod');**

  or do the equivalent in javascript:
  * **var mipod = require('mipod');**
  
  Then, once again, you can either run it as a REST server or as a websocket server.
  
  For REST, register routes by calling:
  * **mipod.asRest(app, opts)** "app" is your own _express_ application, "opts" is a set of options equivalent to the ones described above (typescript: interface IOptions from Options.ts):

    * dataPath: string
    * useLibCache: boolean
    * prefix: string
    * loadLibOnStartup: boolean
    * mpdHost: string
    * mpdPort: number

  For websocket:
  * **mipod.asWebSocket(socket, opts)** where "socket" is a Socket object from ''socket.io''. "opts" is the same than above.

### Tree and leaf descriptors
Some commands sent to MPD will return a list of entries, which are basically directories, playlist files and song files with metadata. **Mipod has the ability to organize them the way you want**. You would like sometimes to get them as flat lists, or as trees organized by albums, artists, etc. That's what treeDesc and leafDesc are for.

A **tree descriptor** describes the successive levels of the tree. For instance if you want to get all songs organized by genre, then inside genres organized by artists, and finally by albums, you would write the following tree descriptor (the order matters!): ["genre","artist","album"]. A special character, "|", can be used as a "if exists / else" selector. If instead of "artist" you write "albumArtist|artist", it means that mipod will first search for the album artist of a song, then if it's not found it will search for the artist. You can have more than one pipe in a tree level.

A **leaf descriptor** describes the final level of the tree (that is, leaves). For instance, if your tree is just ["album"] and your leaf is ["artist","title","track","file"], then a map of albums will be returned, and for each album an array of objects, each containing artist, title, track and file information.

The available names are:
* file
* lastModified
* time
* artist
* albumArtist
* title
* album
* track
* date
* genre
* composer

## Examples

### REST
```javascript
    // Play (with jQuery)
    $.ajax({
        type: 'GET',
        url: '/mipod/play',
        cache: false,
        success: function(data) {},
    });

    // Play a file
    $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '/mipod/play',
        data: JSON.stringify({entry: "some/music/file.mp3"}),
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        success: function(data) {},
    });

    // Load library
    $.get("/mipod/loadonce", function(data) {
        loadPage({
            start: 0,
            count: 1000
        });
    }, 'json');

    function loadPage(loadingInfo) {
        $.post('/mipod/get/' + loadingInfo.start + '/' + loadingInfo.count, {},
            function(pageInfo) {
                // Process data (add "pageInfo.data" to client layout)
                if (pageInfo.finished) {
                    // Finished..
                } else {
                    loadingInfo.start = pageInfo.next;
                    setTimeout(function() {
                        loadPage(loadingInfo);
                    }, 300);
                }
            }, 'json')
        .fail(function() {
            // Report failure...
            setTimeout(function() {
                loadPage(loadingInfo);
            }, 300);
        });
    }
```
